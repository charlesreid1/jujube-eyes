<h2>Button-Chart Linking</h2>

In this chart, we load external JSON data and use it to create buttons.
Those buttons call functions that filter the data,
and show that particular code in the bar chart.

The data being plotted are manners of death for different ICD 10 codes.

This chart needs improving by adding on/off state for buttons,
and adding multiple ICD 10 codes for inter-comparison.
