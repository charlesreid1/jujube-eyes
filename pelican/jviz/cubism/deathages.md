<h2>Cubism Plots: Manner of Death versus Age</h2>

In these charts, we plot a time series representing the number of deaths
that occur, corresponding to a given birth year. Areas of darker color
indicate higher rates of death. By plotting this information, it is possible
to visually spot trends in manners of death versus age.

These visualizations utilize static plots in Cubism, 
which is really intended for real-time displays and dashboards,
but this type of plot was too useful to pass up.
